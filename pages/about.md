### SUMMARY
__I am a person who always tries to Challenge my limit.__

<br/>
As a coder, I don't know what track I should get into.<br/>
So, I've tried all track.<br/>
Game, app, frontend, Server, PM, Designer, even a leader of some coding clubs and researcher. <br/>
As a result, I figured out that I fit the Backend(Server). <br/>
But I assure you that I can do any position in any project.<br/> 
I am the allrounder. <br/>
